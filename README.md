#Djio

I just got my Raspberry Pi, and, coincidentally, a brand new set of speakers. So I thought to myself, why not combine both?

Djio is a play on the word (letters?) "DJ" and "Twilio". I should probably include Spotify in that too, but I guess I'm just not clever enough.

You text the song you want to be played to a number provided by Twilio and, a server I will write in C will be running on my Raspberry Pi that will play any song texted.
